## Test Cases
- Component should work across all major browsers - Chrome / Mozilla / Safari / Opera / IE etc.
- Verify all exposed public properties are working independently and with complex combination.
- Verify all exposed methods and events are working.
- Same set of code should work across three views i.e. Desktop/ Tablet and Mobile
- Validations should work for Mandatory fields
- User-info component should work separately for single and multi passengers.
- User-info component items are - Header stripe, 2 line placeholders, title, first name, last name, email, contact code and phone.
- "2 line placeholder" -If no content given, system should handle the space/alignment.
- Header stripe will display- Room name, bed type and occupancy.
- Adult 1, Adult 2.... label will appear only if multiple passenger information is required.
- When to capture all passengers' information will be derived form APIs.
- "Choose guest" drop down will be available from room 2 and will populate the passengers list entered in room 1 & so on to other rooms.
- After selection of guest from drop down will show information in expanded view with cross icon and click on cross will reset to previous position
- All label like Adult 1 (12+ yrs), child 1 (< 11 yrs) etc. and validation error messages will be managed from resources.
- For now user info component is showing Title, first and last name in single line but suppose some business owner don't want to capture "title" in user-info, In that case business owner can hide "title" field and "first" & "last" name field should equally distribute the vacant position. Similar behavior applies to other fields.

## Steps to Start
- Set Github repository at your end for this project, we will merge them later
- You can use Google/Vaadin's elements (like calendar element and text boxes etc.)

## Performance standard
- Any component if opened via [web page tester](https://www.webpagetest.org/), it should load under 500ms (milli seconds).
